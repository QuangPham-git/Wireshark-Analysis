Overview:
This project demonstrates network security analysis using Wireshark and Snort IDS. It focuses on capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify vulnerabilities, such as plaintext credentials and hidden traffic, and implements Snort for real-time intrusion detection and alerting.

Tools Used:
Wireshark: For capturing and filtering network traffic, analyzing protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and authentication.

Snort IDS: For configuring and monitoring intrusion detection rules to detect suspicious network activities, such as brute-force attacks and unauthorized logins.


Key Features:
Wireshark Analysis: Captures and inspects network packets, including TCP streams, HTTP headers, and FTP authentication details.

Snort Configuration: Custom rules to detect common network attacks like brute-force SSH attempts and FTP login failures.

Vulnerability Identification: Identified security risks like plaintext credential exposure in FTP and weak HTTP authentication schemes.
